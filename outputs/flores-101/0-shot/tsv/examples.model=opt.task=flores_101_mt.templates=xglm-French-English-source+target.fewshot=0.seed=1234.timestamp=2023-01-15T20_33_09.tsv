French: Plusieurs personnes ont vérifié la découverte à l'aide de différents matériels et logiciels au début du mois de février, et elle a été annoncée mardi. = English:	Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software by the beginning of February and it was announced on Tuesday.	Several people have verified the discovery with different tools and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.  The discovery was made by a team of astronomers led by Jean-Luc Margot of the University of California, Los Angeles.  The team used the Keck Observatory in Hawaii to observe the star, which is located about 1,500 light-years from Earth.  The star is about the same size as our sun, but it is much younger, only about 10 million years old.  The star is surrounded by a disk of dust and gas, which is the source of the planet's heat.  The planet is about the same size as Jupiter, but it orbits much closer to its star, completing a full orbit in just over a day.  The planet is also very hot, with a temperature of about 1,000 degrees Celsius.  The planet is so close to its star that it is tidally locked, meaning that one side of the planet is always facing the star, just as the moon is tidally locked to Earth.  The astronomers also found evidence of a second planet in the system, which is about the same size as Neptune.  The planet is located about twice as far from the star as the Earth is from the sun.  The planet is also very cold, with a temperature of about minus 300 degrees Celsius.  The astronomers said that the planet is likely to be a gas giant, like Neptune, and it is likely to be a "hot Neptune" like the planet in our own solar system.

The first information about Taiwan dates back to the 16th century, while European navigators passing by there mentioned it under the name of “ Beautiful Island ”.  The name Formosa was first used in 1542 by Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan, who sighted the island during his circumnavigation of the world. The name Formosa was used by the Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, and English to refer to the island. The Dutch East India Company (VOC) established a trading post on the island in 1624, and the Dutch formally claimed the island in 1662. The Dutch were expelled from Taiwan in 1662, and the island was ceded to the Qing dynasty in 1683.  The Qing dynasty ruled Taiwan as a province of China until the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949. The Republic of China (ROC) was established on the mainland in 1912, and after losing the Chinese Civil War, the ROC government fled to Taiwan in 1949. The ROC government has continued to claim sovereignty over Taiwan, but the People's Republic of China (PRC) has asserted sovereignty over the island since the PRC's founding in 1949.  The name Formosa was used by the ROC government to refer to Taiwan, and the name Taiwan was used by the PRC government to refer to the island. The PRC government has since adopted the name "Taiwan" as the official name of the island.
